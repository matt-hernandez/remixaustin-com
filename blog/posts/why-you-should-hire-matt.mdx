## Who is he?

Matt Hernandez is a web developer who's been in the game for a little while now. Originally
a graduate of UT Austin with a degree in film, he switched over to web development when
working in movies wasn't all it was cracked up to be.

## How did he get here?

He quickly found a knack for the job and discovered it to be very fulfilling. Not to
mention the pay difference! He quickly realized that he didn't just want to do this job. He
wanted to be really good at it. He made the moves necessary to quickly find himself among
other amazing developers who would inspire him to be his best.

## What's he doing now?

Today, Matt Hernandez is at Secureworks. It's a good place to work, but it's a company that
is fully 100% Angular, which has started to finally wear down on him. Angular is not a framework
asking him to get in touch with his original goal at the start of this journey: to be good at the job
and have fun while doing it. He remembers the days of coding in React at his previous job, Idean,
and finds himself wistfully reminiscing about those days. He's putting down all the effort possible
to get back into it.

Obviously this blog post is for testing purposes only. The actual premise is true, but if this
blog every ships to prod, this post will be replaced with a real one.
