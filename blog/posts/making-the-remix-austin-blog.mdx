# So how did we get here?

Well, it starts well before I got here. But if I'm going to play historian, I'll say it all
began with a [discussion](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/discussions/1).
As a subset of the greater Remix community, there was talk of what exactly this site was going
to be other than a place to highlight the date of the next Austin Remix Meetup. What kind of
greater impact did we want to have on all the Remixers out there?

The rumblings of having a blog began back there, but they really started to move from idea
to conception when our good friend Colby White [decided to chime in with a plan](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/discussions/89).

# Enter me

A month after Colby White's vision of what a blog implementation of Remix could be, that's when I
showed up. As a developer trying to get back into the React community after spending 3 years coding
nothing but Angular at my full time job (seriously y'all, Angular is not cool and I want out
so bad ðŸ˜…), I needed a way to sharpen up my old skills.

I showed up to a few React meetups in the Austin area, and through the word of mouth heard about the
Remix Austin meetup. I showed up, heard some amazing talks, hung out with cool people, and figured
this was a good way to get involved.
