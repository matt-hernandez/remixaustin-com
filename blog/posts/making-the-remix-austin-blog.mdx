## So how did we get here?

Well, it starts well before I got here. But if I'm going to play historian, I'll say it all
began with a [discussion](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/discussions/1).
As a subset of the greater Remix community, there was talk of what exactly this site was going
to be other than a place to highlight the date of the next Austin Remix Meetup. What kind of
greater impact did we want to have on all the Remixers out there?

The rumblings of having a blog began back there, but they really started to move from idea
to conception when our good friend Colby White [decided to chime in with a plan](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/discussions/89).
A few things began to take shape at that point, some more discussion, an [early PR with mock
blog content](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/pull/86). But from what I can tell,
nothing managed to solidify just yet.

## Where did I come in?

A month after Colby White's vision of what a blog implementation of Remix could be, that's when I
showed up. As a developer trying to get back into the React community after spending 3 years coding
nothing but Angular at my full time job (seriously y'all, Angular is not cool and I want out
so bad ðŸ˜…), I needed a way to sharpen up my old skills.

I went to a few React meetups in the Austin area, and through the word of mouth heard about the
Remix Austin meetup. I showed up, heard some amazing talks, hung out with cool people, and figured
this was a good way to get involved.

## Steal like an artist

I'm a big fan of using a file system as a CMS, especially for smaller blogs that only see new posts
on an occasional basis. Most developers already have a good deal of familiarity with markdown and
static site generators have been allowing devs like us to websites from markdown since the dawn of docpad.

I was happy to see in Colby's discussion that he also liked the filesystem
approach to a certain degree and had actually gone down that route when making his [own website](https://colbywhite.dev/).
In his website, he uses `.mdx` files to write markdown posts with a little bit of React flavor.

So my next move was simple? Steal his work!

With credit, of course! But hey, don't repeat work that's already been done for you. And thanks
almost exclusively to my timing in this project, I was the unlikely benefactor of Colby's
hard work <span className="text-xxs">Hehehehe</span>. I branched off a [previous PR for an initial blog implementation from Seth Davis](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/pull/86)
and then got to work. I explored the Github repo for Colby's website, found the pieces concerned
with parsing `.mdx` files into a consumable format, and then whole hog copied and
pasted that stuff over.

I gotta admit, during the whole process, I only had about a 50% understanding of how everything worked.
Honestly, I just kind of let the compiler act as my guide. Module not found error?
Great! What did I not steal that I was supposed to? Let me go back to Colby's
repo and find out it.

With about two hours of copy and paste, some compiler errors, and a few mock blog files, I was
able to get an [initial working solution in our site](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/pull/91/commits/971f180faa14c8dc672d8cb0ee66866ced24a248).

## We got the goods. Now what?

The solution technically worked, but it was lacking quite a bit. The first being understanding.
I'm no fan of "copy and paste" into production code. Sure, publicly available solutions are great
starting points. But you shouldn't put any code into a codebase that you don't understand.

I took a good long look at what I copied and got my head around how it worked. The basic idea was this:
there's a NodeJS script that takes all of the `.mdx` files and any of their React component dependencies
and compiles them using `mdx-bundler`. The final result is a JSON array, with each post as an
object in that array. Those objects have some frontmatter and a raw source string for a React
component. That React component is the full content of the blog post.

The array then gets written into a file called `post-cache.json` in our `public`
directory, making it available to all loaders in the site. Loaders for the blog list route and the
individual blog post route make a fetch for the file, pick out the data they need, and inject it
into the page like a regular React component.

And lastly, all `.mdx` files are watched by Node when we run this script in development mode. If any
of their content changes, `post-cache.json` is regenerated with the updated contents.

So this is pretty good, right? But it could be better.

For starters, the `post-cache.json` file was being created in both development mode and production mode.
I wasn't fan of making this file for every single blog change when running the app in development mode.
Ideally, I would like a cached version of this file to exist in memory during development mode,
and only to exist on the file system after a production build. We also weren't seeing live reload
functionality in our app when blog posts would change because the Remix dev server doesn't watch
`public` for changes.

These are all good things to fix, but they take some serious thought into how to do it right.

## Where to begin?

First thing was to start caching `post-cache.json` in development mode. Unfortunately, the Remix
dev server and compile process is pretty closed off outside of the configuration options available
in `remix.config.js`. So we couldn't rely on Remix being able to cache this file for us.
Which means we gotta go back. How far back? BACK TO THE FUTURE MARTY!!

Not really. Back to the days of running a simple HTTP server locally. Big shoutout if you ever
had to run one of these in Python or Node.

I wrote a script that took the compile functionality for `.mdx` files but eliminated the part where it
actually wrote a JSON file. Instead, it would hold on to the contents of the JSON array in a local
variable. Then it would start a small HTTP server on localhost alongside the Remix dev server.
We now have two servers running, one for Remix, and one for the blog content.

Inside our Remix app, I wrote a conditional to check to see if `process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"`.
If that was the case, then our app would send a request for `post-cache.json` but to our other local
server. Our other server would listen for that request and send back its local variable contents as
`post-cache.json`.

BOOM! We now have the ability to serve a file in dev without actually having it on the file system.
But we're still missing something.

How do we get auto-refresh when blog content changes? Well pretty much all auto-refresh behavior in
any library these days is handled by a websocket. In fact, if you dig into the `<LiveReload>` component
in Remix and go to the compiled code, you'll see that it's basically just setting up a `<script>`
that only appears in the client in dev mode. This `<script>` connects to the Remix dev server websocket
and starts listening for messages to trigger a reload.

<BlogImage
  src={websocketImage}

I started out this project stealing other solutions, so why stop now?

I made my own websocket server in the same script that runs my HTTP server. This websocket is what's
actually watching the blog posts for changes. If any of them change, a message is fired that looks
like this: `websocket.send('{ "type": "RELOAD" }')`.

I then made a `<BlogLiveReload>` component that does almost the same thing as the Remix `<LiveReload>`,
only ours targets the websocket server I made explicitly. If it receives a message of type `"RELOAD"`
it auto-refreshes the browser and our blog changes show up instantly.

## And that's that!

So what did we learn and what do we still have to do?

Well, the Remix community seems to be in need of a solid, popular solution to blog integration.
In fact, that's what [Colby White's original discussion](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com/discussions/89)
was trying to solve. And while our solution is good, it still has some rough edges.

For one, we are able to load images into these blog posts. But the way we are doing it is by using
the esbuild plugin `remark-mdx-images` with `mdx-bundler`. This plugin turns our images into base64
encoded URLs. Not bad per se, but the output is so large that it severly bloats our `post-cache.json`
file with gibberish data. One single post can weigh as much as 2 MB even after image optimization.
YIKES!

We could work on a solution to copy images into our build, but then we have to deal with how
to keep our URLs working for both a dev environment and a prod environment, plus cache busting on
production.

But even with that latter solution, we still run into one big problem, which is that filebased CMS
systems are always small. If we keep growing, we're going to hit a point where we can't keep doing this.
There's only so many images and content our codebase can hold. Remix doesn't have a
recommended way to integrate with a third-party CMS via API. We may have to figure it out ourselves
yet again.

## Maybe this is where you come in

We only got to this point thanks to the efforts of so many people, from Seth Davis' original PR,
to Colby White's musings about the state of Remix and CMS-es, to me integrating strategies from multiple
people into one cohesive whole, to the overall support of the Remix Austin community.

We are interested in taking these lessons and using them to impact all of the Remix community, not
just the one here in Austin. We'd ideally like to make a utility library that can act as the solid
solution we wish we could have had at the beginning. And we'd like to make all the optimizations
that will allow it to scale.

If you're interested, please let us know via our [GitHub](https://github.com/remix-austin/remixaustin-com)
or find some of us on our socials. We'll be improving what we have in the meantime. We hope you're
there to see it!
